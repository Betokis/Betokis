<h3>🛡️ Cybersecurity</h3>
My fascination with technology began at a young age, driving me to build programs and assemble my own PCs. However, over the last four years, I've found a greater challenge and interest in exploring system vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. It turns out that understanding how to 'break' things ethically is far more complex—and fun!—than just building them.

<h3>🎧 Music Production & Theory</h3>
My deep love for music is rooted in my childhood. My brother, who has always been my closest friend, introduced me to playing the piano and later opened the doors to the complex world of digital music production. I find a unique parallel between the logic of coding and the structure of musical composition, often using code to explore generative music concepts.

<h3>💻 Full-Stack Development</h3>
I thrive on bringing ideas from concept to deployment. I am the creator of **IB Connection** ([Figma Site](https://floret-reader-02117305.figma.site)), an organizational platform designed to help students, especially those struggling with time management. I specialize in developing robust and scalable applications across the entire stack.

<h3>📖 Diaries & Learning</h3>
> On the music score, we learned the theory, but only after spending time with others did we truly understand the music.
